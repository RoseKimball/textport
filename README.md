## About
The aim of textport is to allow users to highlight article information in different colors and export it, along with the source URL, to a Google Document. It is intuitive and simple to use, and anyone can download it from the Google Chrome Web Store.


## texport allows you to:

* highlight text on a webpage 
* view it anytime by clicking on the extension 
* copy/export it with the source link

## Next Steps
In the coming week, we will be finishing the functionality of textport so users can export their sourcing and information to a Google Doc. Creating an extension that quickly allowed us to gather research information for a report/paper with the source URL was one of the primary goals for this project, and we believe this is a good start. Beyond that, we genuinely believe this could take care of collecting sources and direct quotes, allowing people more time to do their work.
